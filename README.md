# Desktop Shark
This is a very simple app that is just a shark that floats around on your desktop.  
He does not bite (unless you enable cursor chomping).  
There is a very minimal settings screen that can be accessed by right-clicking on the shark.  
Needless to say, since this is a Windows Forms app, this only works on Windows.

## Brief Settings Explanation
- Always on Top: If true, the shark will always be on top of all other forms.
- Seconds between Moving: The idle time betweeen movement.
- I Am Speed: Makes the shark speedy (comparatively; it's still not super fast).
- Follow Cursor: If true, the shark will follow the cursor around rather than moving randomly.
- Enable Cursor Chomping: If true, there is a chance that the shark will chase the cursor and eat it. This is more aggressive and less endearing than Follow Cursor.
- Probability of Chase: The probability that the shark will decide to chase the cursor rather than doing a regular move. Do not set this to 100% unless you want to be wholly unproductive.
