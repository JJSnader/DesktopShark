### Desktop Shark
This is a very simple app that is just a shark that floats around on your desktop.  
He does not bite (unless you enable cursor chomping).  
There is a very minimal settings screen that can be accessed by right-clicking on the shark.  
Needless to say, since this is a Windows Forms app, this only works on Windows.
